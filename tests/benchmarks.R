# Local takes 10 - 40 MICROSECONDS

# SparkR
# BEFORE: 502 seconds
# AFTER: 508 seconds
#
# SimpleSpark
# N = 5     2.98 seconds
# N = 20    7.52 seconds
# N = 100   39.5 seconds
# N = 500   320 seconds
#
# Here N corresponds to the number of partitions in the data, and also the
# number of R processes that Spark needs to spin up. 
#
# So we may just be measuring the overhead of spinning up R processes,
# which isn't really that interesting.
